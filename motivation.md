Dear Lo√Øc,

I am excited to apply for the Scrum Master position at your company. With experience in agile methodologies and a track record of enhancing team productivity, I would love to contribute to your projects.

I am currently in a Scrum Master position at Processia where I coach a team developing AI solutions. My daily tasks involve facilitating Scrum ceremonies, removing impediments, and pushing towards continuous improvement. I'm used to software like Jira, Confluence, Miro, etc.

My background includes roles in customer service and problem-solving, from office management to cabin crew at Emirates, which have honed my leadership skills.

I hold PSM I & II certifications and am fluent in English, German, and Polish. I am also learning French at a beginner level. I have been working in several countries and continents, and I have the ability to learn very fast. I am currently preparing for my Product Owner certification to add a new tool to my toolset.

In my personal life, I have been using blockchain technology and DeFi platforms like AAVE, Kamino, Uniswap, and Jupiter for about two years. I have a decent understanding of these technologies from an end-user perspective and I am proficient in managing my own transactions using my Ledger.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing with you how I can contribute.

Best regards,

Kinga Wenta
